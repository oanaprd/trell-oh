- Each list contains cards, which can be moved between lists.
- Each card can have titles, descriptions, checklists, due dates, labels and comments.
- Drag-and-drop functionality.
- No support for creating and logging in users.
- No collaboration implementation.
- No notifications.

TODO: Metrics Collection
- Daily Active Users to measure the app's user base growth and engagement over time. If retention rates are low during onboarding, the app may be too complex or not intuitive.
- Board and Card Interactions to identify which features are used most or least. If many users create boards but few add labels, they may find labels confusing or unnecessary.
- Funnel Analysis to track the journey of users from visiting the app to becoming active users. If a significant portion of users churn after a free trial, it may indicate insufficient perceived value in the paid tier.
- Error and Crash Reports to monitor app stability and performance issues. If users frequently churn due to bugs or crashes, it highlights a need for a better testing and performance monitoring.
